Distributions
-------------

Discrete

* binomial, $\Pr(x; n, \pi): probability of x hits in $n$ draws 
* neg-binomial, $\Pr(x; f, \pi): probability of $x$ hits by $f$th failure.

Continuous

* poisson, $\pr(x; \lambda t)$: probability of x hits in $t$ time
* exponential, $\Pr(t; \lambda)$: probability of $t$ time before next hit
* gamme, WRITE: probability of $t$ time before $\alpha$ hits
